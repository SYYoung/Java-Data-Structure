## SocialNetworks (Capstone Project - Week 1)

This repository contains an implementation of the following graph algorithms. 

1) Extracting the Egonet of each node/user in a social network graph: The Egonet is a single user is the subgraph that contains the user, his friends and all the friendships/edges between those friends. 

2) Extracting all the Strongly Connected Components of a social network. A Strongly Connected Component of a directed graph is a subgraph where for each pair of nodes v and u there's a path in both directions between v and u. We use Kosaraju's algorithm for this purpose.

These algorithms were implemented as part of the Capstone Project of the **Java Programming: Object-Oriented Design of Data Structures** specialization in Coursera. 

Data files and information about them can be found in the data/ directory.

## Setup

Importing Project into eclipse:
- Create a new Java Project in your workspace
- Import the starter files:
- File -> Import -> Select "File System" -> Next -> Browse and set root directory to folder contents of zip were extracted to -> Finish
